It was completed on September 17, 1787, with its adoption by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was later ratified by special conventions in each state. It created a federal union of sovereign states, and a federal government to operate that union. It replaced the less defined union that had existed under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. It took effect on March 4, 1789 and has served as a model for the constitutions of numerous other nations. The Constitution of the United States of America is the oldest written national constitution in use.''

The Constitution is the second of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], with [[Additional amendments to the United States Constitution|later amendments]]. This edition was originally taken from the [http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution.html US House of Representatives web site].

== Preamble ==
<!-- Here I added a clause defining what the term "The People" refers to, so that corporations do not get counted as people. -->
We, the People, the unique human beings making up the citizenry of these United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

== Article I - The Legislative Branch ==

=== Section 1 - Overview of the Legislative Branch ===
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate, a House of Representatives, and a General Assembly.

=== Section 2 - The House of Representatives ===
The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. There shall be no limit on the number of two-year terms that a person may serve in the House of Representatives, unless the constitution of the State which they are representing specifies otherwise.

No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be a legal inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.

<!-- This clause is meant to encourage compromise by encouraging Representatives to actually pass bills.
Although this could result in them just passing pointless laws to fulfill this requirement, I suppose that still be okay... -->
No incumbent Representative, who has served an entire term, shall be eligible for re-election if he has neither voted on nor proposed any bills during that term that then subsequently went on to become law.

Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. The actual Enumeration having been made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, all subsequent Censuses or Enumerations shall be made within every subsequent term of ten years after that, in such manner as the House of Representatives shall by Law direct. Each State shall have at least one Representative for each Senator that they have, and the number of representatives shall be apportioned to each state in as fair a method as may be reasonably determined. While States may choose to have their voters either select their Representatives by Congressional Districts, or by elections At-Large, or by whatever other fair method the States may reasonably determine, if a State is to use the Congressional Districts method of dividing up its residents, these Districts shall be drawn in a fair manner that reflects existing geographical regions within the State, so far as this can be done while still respecting the principle of "One Person, One Vote," at the same time. The Congress shall have the power to set exact criteria for fairness in the drawing of Congressional Districts, by passing appropriate legislation.

When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.

The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Declaring Impeachments.

=== Section 3 - The Senate ===
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of three Senators from each State, chosen in an election in that State in which the winning candidate shall be the one that at least two of the three of the following: a plurality of votes of the people of that state, a plurality of votes of the Legislature of that State, and the approval of the Executive Authority of that state. Each Senator shall be elected for a term of six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. There shall be no limit on the total number of six-year terms that a Senator may serve, unless the constitution of the State which they are representing specifies otherwise.

Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, the Senators from each state shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that each state may chose one of their three Senators every second Year. When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the vacancies are filled in an election as the legislature may direct. Winners in these special elections shall be chosen in the same way as winners of senatorial elections are normally chosen.

No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be a legal inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.

No incumbent Senator, who has served an entire term, shall be eligible for re-election if he has neither voted on nor proposed any bills during that term that then subsequently went on to become law.

The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President Pro Tempore by seniority, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when said Vice President shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments declared by the House of Representatives. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members of the Senate who are present.

Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

=== Section 4 - The General Assembly ===
The General Assembly of the United States shall not represent any state in particular, but shall instead represent the country at large. It shall consist of one member per every million people in the population of the United States, as determined by the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to take place. Each Assemblyperson shall be chosen by lottery, certified to be random (in a manner similar to how people have traditionally been selected for jury duty), from the entire population of the United States that has registered an interest of serving with the General Assembly, and who shall meet the requirements for service stated in this section. Each Assemblyperson shall serve a single term of five years. 

No person shall serve as an Assemblyperson who shall not have attained the age of twenty years, and been five years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not have voted in the most recent national election preceding the lottery. As the General Assembly is randomly chosen and not elected, after the first lottery in which Assemblypeople are selected, the other two chambers of Congress may specify other reasonable qualifications that Assemblypersons must meet, such as a requirement that Assemblypeople have a certain level of education, provided that a majority of the currently-serving Assemblypersons concur. These additional qualifications may not conflict with, or make impossible to meet, any of the currently specified qualifications for Assemblypersons outlined in this Constitution, or anything else in this Constitution. Any additional qualifications added in this way shall not be required until the following lottery for the selection of Assemblypersons, and no qualifications added in this way shall make any currently-serving Assemblypersons ineligible for their office.

The Assemblypersons shall choose their officers on a rotating basis, such that each member has a chance to hold each office that they may decide to create.

The General Assembly shall hold the primary responsibility for hearing any petitions for redress that the people may bring before the Congress; and if any members of the other chambers of Congress feel they are unable to satisfactorily respond to their constituents' requests, questions, and concerns, they may direct said constituents to consult the General Assembly instead. Any citizen wishing to contact a congressperson of whom they are not constituents may also be directed to consult the General Assembly instead as well.

=== Section 5 - Special Dates ===
The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.

The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.

=== Section 6 - Powers Possessed By Each Chamber of Congress ===
Each Chamber of Congress shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each Chamber may provide.

Each Chamber may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.

Each Chamber shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting, in rare cases, such Parts as may in their best Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of any of the three chambers on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. The public's right of access to the publications of this Journal shall not be unreasonably restricted.

No Chamber, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the consent of at least one of the other two Chambers, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the three Chambers shall be sitting.

=== Section 7 - Privileges Held and Not Held By Congresspeople ===
The Senators, Representatives, and Assemblypersons shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

No Senator, Representative, or Assemblyperson shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of any of the three Houses during his Continuance in Office.

=== Section 8 - Interaction Between the Chambers ===
All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills. The General Assembly may simply vote to concur with this type of Bill.

Every Bill which shall have passed at least two out of the three of chambers of Congress, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that chamber in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds of that chamber shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other chamber or chambers that passed it, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that chamber as well, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of all chambers shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (weekends excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the concurrence of multiple chambers of Congress may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the passing chambers, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.

=== Section 9 - Enumerated Powers of Congress ===
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts that it may incur, and to provide for the common defense and general health, welfare, safety, and happiness of the United States and its people (as specified in the Preamble to this Constitution), and for justice between all said people; but all Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises levied to pay for these purposes shall be uniform throughout the states of the United States;

To exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards and other needful Buildings;—And

To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, the unenumerated Powers that Congress may reasonably be considered to possess, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.

If there is any doubt as to whether Congress has the power to pass a certain Bill under one of the criteria enumerated above, or under any other criterion that has its basis in the Constitution, the Chamber of Congress in which the Bill is currently being discussed may request the Supreme Court to issue an Advisory Opinion on the Constitutionality of the Bill in question. Advisory Opinions issued in this way are non-binding.

=== Section 10 - Restrictions on Congressional Power ===

The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or physical invasion the public safety may require it.

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.

== Article II - The Executive Branch ==

=== Section 1 - Overview of The Executive Branch ===
The executive power shall be vested in the Executive Branch of Government, headed by the President and Vice President of the United States of America, and advised by a Cabinet of his choosing and by a popularly elected Executive Council.

=== Section 2 - Election of The President === 
The President shall hold his Office during the term of four years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:

Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President. These votes shall reflect the vote of the people of the electors' respective states. After the electors have cast their ballots, they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the current President of the Senate;

The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.

The person having the greatest Number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have qualified.

The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.

The Congress may determine the time of choosing the Electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.

No person shall eligible for the Office of the Vice President, who does not meet the same qualifications required of the President, and who is not a resident of a different state than the President at the time of their election.

In case of the removal of the President from Office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.

Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

=== Section 3 - Powers of The President ===
The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of Impeachment.

He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

=== Section 4 - Responsibilities of The President ===
The President shall from time to time give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union in whatever form he sees fit (whether it be a speech or other method of communication), and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene all three Houses, or any combination of them, or any single House, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers; he shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the Officers of the United States.

=== Section 5 - The Executive Council ===
The Executive Council shall consist in one member from a pairing between each of the states, chosen in elections every four years by the citizens of each pairing of respective states. The states shall be paired as follows: After the Census or Enumeration specified herein has taken place, the states shall be ranked in order of population. The most populous state shall be paired with the least populous, the second-most populous with the second-least populous, and so on. In the event that there is an odd number of states and exactly one state is the median state, the median state shall be paired with the citizens of the District constituting the seat of Government of the United States. These four-year elections for Executive Council shall be staggered evenly between the four-year elections of the President, so as to provide continuity in the Executive Branch between administrations. In the event that a Census or Enumeration shall occur in the middle of an Executive Council term, the new pairings based on that Census or Enumeration shall not be applied until the following election. There shall be no limit on the total number of four-year terms that an Executive Councilor may serve, unless the constitution of both of the States in the pair that has elected him specifies otherwise. In the case of a single median state, only a specification in that single state's constitution shall be necessary to impose term limits on that Executive Councilor. As pairings are liable to shift with population changes, term limits specified by state constitutions shall only apply to the terms of Executive Councilors in which they represent the same pair of states.

No person shall be an Executive Councilor who shall not have attained to the age of forty years, and been twenty years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be a legal inhabitant of one of the two States in the pairing of states for which he shall be chosen.

The Executive Council shall assist the President in the distribution of his executive orders amongst the various departments to which the given executive order is relevant.

The Executive Council shall assist the President in deciding which Reprieves and Pardons to grant, and in which persons to nominate for the offices that the President has been granted the power to make nominations for herein. If a federal office for which the president is supposed to make a nomination remains unfilled one hundred and eighty days after its initial vacancy, and the President has yet to make his own nomination for the position, the Executive Council may make a nomination for that position instead.

One week after the President actually does make a nomination to one of the offices mentioned previously, if the Senate fails to tell the President one way or another whether or not they shall give him the advice and consent that they are constitutionally required to give on such nominations, the President shall then be entitled to ask the Executive Council for that same advice and consent instead.

The Executive Council shall be responsible for the smooth functioning of Executive Branch agencies, and shall regularly review their budgets.

=== Section 6 - Removal From Office, and Compensation for Services ===
The President, Vice President, Cabinet, Executive Council, and all other Civil Officers in the Executive Branch of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and felonies.

The President, Vice President, Cabinet, Executive Council, and all other Civil Officers in the Executive Branch of the United States shall, at stated times, receive for their Services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which those of them that have been elected shall have been elected, and they shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of single one of the states.

== Article III - The Judicial Branch ==

=== Section 1 - Overview of The Judicial Branch ===
The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Supreme Court shall consist in nine Justices, one of whom shall be designated the Chief Justice. The Judges, both of the Supreme and Inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. No person shall be nominated to the office of Supreme Court Justice who has not ever appeared in a courtroom in any official capacity, whether it be as a judge, attorney, juror, bailiff, police officer, clerk, expert witness, or any other official position that a lower court may choose to establish.

=== Section 2 - Judicial Power ===
The legal system of the United States shall be able to trace its heritage back to the Common Law system of England, and suits shall be able to be litigated within this system.

The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State;—between Citizens of different States;—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.

In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the Supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

After deciding a Case, the Supreme Court shall issue an opinion (or multiple opinions) justifying the reasoning behind the Court's decision. These opinions shall have the force of Precedent. If any Justices dissent from the majority opinion of the Court, they shall issue separate dissenting opinions, explaining their reasoning why they think the majority decided the case incorrectly. While dissenting opinions shall not have the force of Precedent on their own, they may be cited in future opinions that overturn Precedent. Generally Courts should respect Precedent, and should only overturn Precedent when absolutely necessary. The Courts may interpret when it is "absolutely necessary" at their own discretion. 

In deciding a Case, the Supreme Court may decide that it needs the power of Judicial Review in order to correctly decide that case. In granting itself the power of Judicial Review, the Court may then strike down a law that is in question in the case at hand, on the grounds that that law is Unconstitutional. To do this, the opinion of the Court must cite the specific portion of the Constitution that the Law in question violates. Generally, the Court shall exercise restraint in granting itself the power of Judicial Review, as overturning a law desired by a majority of the people in a democratic republic is a serious matter. For this reason, the Court shall only use the power of Judicial Review in cases where it could not decide the case fairly without otherwise doing so, or in cases where it is necessary to protect an oppressed minority from an oppressive majority. The Supreme Court may not exercise the power of Judicial Review against any law that it simply believes to be Unconstitutional, unless a party to a lawsuit before the Court specifically makes the argument that the law is Unconstitutional. In other words, the opinions of the Court may not go farther in either direction than either of the parties in the case before the Court argue themselves. Furthermore, the Court may not create issues out of a case that neither of the parties before them in the case bring up themselves.

The Supreme Court shall have the power to decide which cases it hears by issuing Writs of Certiorari, or by other methods to be decided by law.

From time to time, the Supreme Court may request ''Amicus Curiae'' briefs from parties with an interest in a case before the Court, in order to assist the Court in deciding the case. The Supreme Court may choose to ignore any such briefs that it receives that were unrequested.

The Supreme Court shall have the power to issue Advisory Opinions on the constitutionality of proposed laws at the request of any of the three Chambers of Congress, in a manner as described in Article I Section 3 of this Constitution.
