# w_Constitution
This repository is for how I'd edit the Constitution if I could.
I originally started it on Wikisource (since it had its own text of the Constitution there, that I just copied/forked into my userspace),
but I was told that that wasn't the place for doing that, so instead I have now used [`git-remote-mediawiki`](https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki)
to import it into a git repository here.
