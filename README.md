# w_Constitution
This repository is for how I'd edit the Constitution if I could.
I originally started it on [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page) (since it had its own text of [the Constitution](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America) there, that I just [copied/forked into my userspace](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Cooljeanius/Constitution)),
but I [was told that that wasn't the place for doing that](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Cooljeanius), so instead I have now used [`git-remote-mediawiki`](https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki)
to import it into a git repository here.
