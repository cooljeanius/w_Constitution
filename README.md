# w_Constitution
This repository is for my fantasies of how I'd edit the Constitution if I could.
I originally started it on [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page) (since it had its own text of [the Constitution](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America) there, that I just [copied/forked into my userspace](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Cooljeanius/Constitution)),
but I [was told that that wasn't the place for doing that](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Cooljeanius), so instead I have now used [`git-remote-mediawiki`](https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki)
to import it into a git repository here.

A note on wiki-markup: any text found between syntax like this: `<!-- text -->` is a **comment**,
and thus not part of the actual text that I'd be making actionable/legal,
if this were to become our new Constitution.

The "`w_`" in the repository title is for "wiki"; I chose it partially just to try to even out the representation in terms of the letters of the alphabet that have a lot of things starting with them.
