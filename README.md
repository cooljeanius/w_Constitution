# w_Constitution
This repository is for my fantasies of how I'd edit the Constitution if I could.
I originally started it on [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page) (since it had its own text of [the Constitution](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America) there, that I just [copied/forked into my userspace](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Cooljeanius/Constitution)),
but I [was told that that wasn't the place for doing that](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User_talk:Cooljeanius), so instead I have now used [`git-remote-mediawiki`](https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki)
to import it into a git repository here.

A note on wiki-markup: any text found between syntax like this: `<!-- text -->` is a **comment**,
and thus not part of the actual text that I'd be making actionable/legal,
if this were to become our new Constitution.

The "`w_`" in the repository title is for "wiki"; I chose it partially just to try to even out the representation in terms of the letters of the alphabet that have a lot of things starting with them.

### Contributing
Contributing is welcome, although please be aware that since this represents my own wishes for how the Constitution ought to be, any contributions would have to be ones I agree with.
Thus, please see the following breakdown of what a hypothetical contributor's thought processes might look like for contributions I'd accept, vs. those I'd reject (with "you" referring to me):

Good motivations for contributions:
- ✅ "I saw one of your `<!-- TODO: -->` comments in the code and decided to complete it"
- ✅ "I get the idea of what you're going for here, and figured out a way to make it work even better"
- ✅ "I've seen your postings on other platforms about the sorts of policies and philosophies you support, and think that the following Constitutional changes might help enable them"

Bad motivations for contribution attempts:
- ❌ "I have a fundamental philosophical disagreement with your changes here"
- ❌ "I don't like where you're going with this and decided to move in the opposite direction instead"
- ❌ "I have my own pet issue that you've never heard about and/or probably don't care about, and think it deserves special mention in your Constitutional changes here, and no, I haven't bothered to check if any of your other changes already handle it"
